> [!WARNING]
> This repository is for historical purposes only. It is used as a monument to the year 2022, and may be used as a "nostalgia kit" to build older SalernOS versions from that year. The SalernOS Build Environment was discontinued in 2023 and is no longer in use. The [SalernOS repository](https://github.com/Alessandro-Salerno/SalernOS) now holds all the necessary files to build, test, and run SalernOS.

## SalernOS
SalernOS is a small Toy OS I'm working on.

## SalernOS-Buildenv
This repository will help you build SalernOS using CMake and Docker/WSL.

## Setup
Type `make download`

## Instructions
If you're using Docker, type `make enter`; if you're using WSL, a native linux machine or some other emulator, make sure you have all the necessary packages to continue. Once you're on your Linux shell, type `make setup` and wait. Then type `make` and hit enter, this will build all components of the OS.
