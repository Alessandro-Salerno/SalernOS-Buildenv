## SalernOS
SalernOS is a small Toy OS I'm working on.

## SalernOS-Buildenv
This repository will help you build SalernOS using CMake and Docker/WSL.

## Setup
Type `make download`

## Instructions
If you're using Docker, type `make enter`. Then type `make` and wait for the compiler and linker to do their jobs. If you want to build a `.img` file, type `mkdir Output`, followed by `make buildimg`.
