## SalernOS
SalernOS is a small Toy OS I'm working on.

## SalernOS-Buildenv
This repository will help you build SalernOS using CMake and Docker/WSL.

## Setup
Type `make download`

## Instructions
If you're using Docker, type `make enter`; if you're using WSL, a native linux machine or some other emulator, make sure you have all the necessary packages to continue. Once you're on your Linux shell, type `make setup` and wait. Then type `make` and hit enter, this will build all components of the OS.
